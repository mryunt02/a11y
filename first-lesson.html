    <h1>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h1>
    <h2>WCAG Levels:</h2>
    <p>
      A level: Basic web accessibility features. This level addresses the most
      basic web accessibility features.
    </p>
    <p>
      AA level: Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled
      users. This level is generally the target for most websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      AAA level: The highest and most complex level of web accessibility. This
      level is typically not required for most websites as it is very difficult
      to achieve.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Contrast:</h2>
    <p>
      The contrast between the text color and the background color should be at
      least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
    </p>
    <p class="good-contrast">
      This is an example of good contrast. The text color is black, and the
      background color is white.
      <img
        src="./image-2.png"
        alt="picture of a contrast accessibility"
        class="img"
      />
    </p>
    <p class="bad-contrast">
      This is an example of bad contrast. The text color is light gray, and the
      background color is light gray.
      <img
        src="./image.png"
        alt="picture of a contrast accessibility"
        class="img"
      />
