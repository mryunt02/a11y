    <h1>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h1>
    <p>
      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines that
      ensure that websites are accessible to all users, including those with
      disabilities. The guidelines are divided into four principles:
      Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR).
    </p>
    <div class="principles-container">
      <div class="principle-box">
        <h2>Perceivable:</h2>
        <p>
          Information and user interface components must be presentable to users
          in ways they can perceive. This means that users must be able to
          perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all
          of their senses) and that it must be presented in a way that they can
          perceive it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="principle-box">
        <h2>Operable:</h2>
        <p>
          User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means
          that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot
          require interaction that a user cannot perform) and the interface must
          be navigable (the interface cannot trap the user in a particular
          section of the content).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="principle-box">
        <h2>Understandable:</h2>
        <p>
          Information and the operation of user interface must be
          understandable. This means that users must be able to understand the
          information as well as the operation of the user interface (the
          content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="principle-box">
        <h2>Robust:</h2>
        <p>
          Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a
          wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This
          means that users must be able to access the content as technologies
          advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should
          remain accessible).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>WCAG Levels:</h2>
    <p>
      A level: Basic web accessibility features. This level addresses the most
      basic web accessibility features.
    </p>
    <p>
      AA level: Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled
      users. This level is generally the target for most websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      AAA level: The highest and most complex level of web accessibility. This
      level is typically not required for most websites as it is very difficult
      to achieve.
    </p>

    <h2 id="color-contrast">Color Contrast</h2>
    <p>
      The contrast between the text color and the background color should be at
      least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can easily check the contrast of your website using this
      <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"
        >contrast checker link</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you can use the contrast checker tool in the Chrome browser. Right
      click on the text and select "Inspect". Then click on the "Contrast ratio"
      tab.
    </p>
    <p class="good-contrast">
      This is an example of good contrast. The text color is black, and the
      background color is white.
      <img
        src="./image-2.png"
        alt="picture of a contrast accessibility"
        class="img"
      />
      You can check the contrast of this text using the contrast checker tool or
      Browser contrast checker.
    </p>
    <p class="bad-contrast">
      This is an example of bad contrast. The text color is light gray, and the
      background color is light gray.
      <img
        src="./image.png"
        alt="picture of a contrast accessibility"
        class="img"
      />
      You can check the contrast of this text using the contrast checker tool or
      Browser contrast checker.
    </p>
    <h2 id="alternative-text">Alternative Text</h2>
    <p>
      Alternative text is a text description that can be added to an image's
      HTML tag. This text is read by screen readers to describe the image to
      visually impaired users. The alt text should be descriptive and provide
      the same information as the image. If the image is purely decorative, the
      alt text should be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example of an image with alt text:
      <img
        src="./info.jpeg"
        alt="A person using a screen reader to access a
      website"
        class="img"
      />
      <code
        >&lt;img src="./info.jpeg" alt="A person using a screen reader to access
        a website" class="img" /&gt;</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Example of an image with empty alt text:
      <img src="./decorative.jpeg" alt="" class="img" />
      <code>&lt;img src="./decorative.jpeg" alt="" class="img" /&gt;</code>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
